{"name":"Accessibility Camp - NYC","tagline":"","body":"# Accessibility Camp - New York City \r\n\r\n## Event Information\r\n\r\nThanks for visiting the home of the first Accessibility Camp New York City Area. The event will be hosted by NYU MAGNET2 Metrotech Center (Brooklyn, NY 11201) on Saturday September 26, 2015. Please plan to arrive at 9:30 to register. We will start promptly at 10:00 AM and end at 4:30 PM. The goal of the day is to provide an open, informal space for conversation and networking around digital access and inclusion.\r\n\r\nFocusing on users with different disabilities, sessions can cover digital accessibility topics from the web (technical to tactical), desktop software, mobile apps, eLearning, online gaming, open source innovations, and everything in between. Watch this brief video from the first Accessibility Camp Toronto to get a feel for what to expect during the day.\r\n\r\nRegardless of your level of knowledge, this event is for you. It will be a great opportunity for members of the design/development, usability, accessibility, other IT and end-users with disabilities communities to interact and learn from each other. We recommend you browse the Frequently Asked Questions, especially if you have never attended a participant-driven BarCamp/unconference before.\r\n\r\nPlease follow event updates on Twitter via [a11ynyc](http://twitter.com/@a11ynyc).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
