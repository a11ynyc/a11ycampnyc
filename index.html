      <h2>Event Information</h2>

      <p>New York City's first accessibility camp will be hosted at NYU MAGNET2 Metrotech Center (Brooklyn, NY 11201) on Saturday September 26, 2015.  Focusing on users with different disabilities, sessions can cover digital accessibility topics from the web (technical to tactical), desktop software, mobile apps, eLearning, online gaming, open source innovations, and everything in between. Watch
        this brief video from the first <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeP5Kl4GDgA">Accessibility Camp Toronto</a> to get a feel for what to expect during the day.</p>

      <p>Regardless of your level of knowledge, this event is for you. It will be a great opportunity for members of the design/development, usability, accessibility, other IT and end-users with disabilities communities to interact and learn from each other.
        We recommend you browse the Frequently Asked Questions, especially if you have never attended a participant-driven BarCamp/unconference before.</p>
      </p>

      <p>The event will last from 9am to 5pm.  A schedule of sessions will be announced in the upcoming weeks.  </p>
