      <h3>10:00 - 10:30 Adrian Roselli: Selfish Accessibility</h3>
      We can all pretend that we're helping others by making web sites and software accessible, but we are really making them better for our future selves. Learn some fundamentals of accessibility and how it can benefit you (whether future you from aging or you after something else limits your abilities). We'll review simple testing techniques, basic features and enhancements, coming trends, and where to get help. This isn't intended to be a deep dive into ARIA, but more of an overall primer for those who aren't sure where to start nor how it helps them.

      <h3>10:40 - 11:10 David Friedman: The Adventures of The Disabled Foodie: A Blog Reviewing Restaurant Accessibility</h3>
      David Friedman will speak about how he came about to create his popular blog, The Disabled Foodie (http://thedisabledfoodie.com), where he reviews restaurants on food, service, and accessibility. He will discuss themes he has discovered upon conducting more than 60 reviews since August 2014. Friedman will also discuss next steps for his blog and what he is looking to do next.

      David Friedman is a 38-year-old foodie living in NYC who happens to be disabled. He uses a wheelchair.

      In August 2014 he noticed a need for accessibility information as it pertains to restaurants, food markets, food events, and anywhere else a foodie might venture, so he created his blog, The Disabled Foodie (http://thedisabledfoodie.com), to provide as much of this information as he can to the disability community. He has been featured in amNY, Disability News New York, and on the podcast, The Sporkful.

      He lives in Queens with his husband and two dogs. He works as a teacher for his full-time job.

      <h3>11:20 - 11:50 Mirabai Knight: The Three Prongs of Steno Accessibility</h3>
      Stenographic technology has been used to provide realtime captioning for over 25 years, but two other important potential applications of steno for accessibility are less well known: 1) As a way to rectify the catastrophic levels of underemployment in the blind/low vision community (especially those who use screen readers and are already comfortable processing speech at over 300 WPM) by making it possible for them to become professional realtime captioners, and 2) By integrating it with text-to-speech technology to allow for a truly conversational speech synthesis system for AAC users. In this session, I'll discuss these three potential applications and the way they intersect.

      <h3>12:00 - 12:30 Beth Rosenberg: Teaching Tech to Kids who Learn Differently: Tech Kids Unlimited's Focus on Autism Spectrum Disorder</h3>
      Research increasingly shows (“Young Adults with Autism Can Thrive in High-Tech Jobs” by Lauren Silverman, NPR, April 22, 2013) that adults on the autism spectrum can succeed in a wide range of jobs, provided they have the necessary tech skills and can qualify for jobs that are well adapted to their individual needs.  Technology jobs are particularly suited to many on the autism spectrum, and yet there are few training programs for students geared to this population. Tech Kids Unlimited is a not-for-profit program which is teaching kids on the autism spectrum 21st century tech tools so they can become the next generation of makers and producers.

      <h3>12:30 - 1:30 Lunch Break</h3>

      <h3>1:40 - 2:10 Katherine Moriwaki & Don Undeen: Museum Accessibility: A Parsons and Met MediaLab collaboration</h3>
      In Fall 2013 the MFA Design + Technology program at Parsons School of Design partnered with the MediaLab at the Met to run a collaboration studio on the topic of Museum Accessibility. The course focused on innovative and experimental ways to expand the museum experience for all museum goers using technology. Two faculty from the class, Katherine Moriwaki and Don Undeen will speak about the inspiration, pedagogy, and results from the class and reflect on the experience of students and other stakeholders.

      <h3>2:20 - 2:50 Chandra Carney: Develop with Accessibility in Mind</h3>
      Most developers don't consider that someone with impairments may use the web and don't think about what this experience may be like for someone who has an impairment. We will explore a variety of widely used assistive technologies and how they are used to interface with the web. The talk will dive into tactics to consider when creating good front-facing code that will provide a smooth usability experience with assistive technologies. We will look at examples of sites with good and bad accessibility considerations and how to make both better for users. Attendees will be able to take away easy, effective steps and best practices that they can begin to utilize in their web applications.

      <h3>3:00 - 3:30 Svetlana Kouznetsova: Accessibility Through the Eyes of a Deaf Person</h3>
      When people think about accessibility for deaf and hard of hearing individuals, video captioning, lipreading, and sign language interpreting automatically come to their minds. But it is more than that. My presentation would help attendees better understand that not all deaf and hard of hearing people are same and learn more about various hearing and communication abilities and preferences in various situations.

      <h3>3:40 - 4:10 Sarah Horton and David Sloan: Empathy, Education, and Excellence in Inclusive Design</h3>
      Designing great user experiences for everyone, including people with disabilities, requires shared responsibility across a project team. But how do you motivate and educate project team members to contribute effectively to inclusive design? In this presentation we will discuss ways to use education and user research methods to build empathy for people with disabilities, to better understand and design for diverse user needs.
      Attendees will learn:
      How responsibility for accessibility can be most effectively distributed throughout product teams.
      The importance of empathy for human diversity in helping team members successfully meet their accessibility responsibilities.
      Effective ways of involving people with disabilities in product team education and research activities.
      How to engage the product team with education and research activities and outcome.
