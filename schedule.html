      <h3>10:40 - 11:10 Mark Surabian - Assistive Technology: Solutions for Increasing Learner Independence and Classroom Participation</h3>
      <p>Remediation and therapy take time, whereas technology compensates immediately to enhance learner confidence and access through actual participation until the impact of the former takes hold. AT is an often an effective solution to keep learners with disabilities "engaged and responsible" for their own classwork and keeps them performing at levels more accurate to their real potential throughout their educational careers. This presenter will briefly discuss why AT is often overlooked as a support to enhance learner participation; describe the challenges of functionally incorporating AT into the classroom as depicted through real case studies; and provide an overview of  effective AT tools used for individuals with disabilities.</p>

      <h3>2:20 - 2:50: Phoebe Fico - Access Your Humanity</h3>
      <p>While we have come along way in terms of access, I believe that there is one fundamental thing that we are missing when we speak about it: That we are making things accessible for humans. The access that we currently have is acceptable, but it does not make us feel like people. Through this access we are segregated from mainstream society. In this talk, I will give example of how the current access does this and offer up solutions as to how were can humanize disability access.</p>
      <h4>Speaker Bio</h4>
      <a href="http://twitter.com/phoebefico">@phoebefico</a>
      <p>"When I first went away to college, I had an extremely difficult time getting around campus because of the terrain and snow. I thought my body was the problem. So, I became depressed. So, severely depressed that I didn’t go to class and I almost failed out of school. What I would learn was that that their were systematic barriers at the school—and in the world— that set me up to fail. So, when I came back to school for my sophomore year, I got angry instead of sad and I started a branch of undergraduate government dedicated to students with physical disabilities (the first of its kind at the school and still going strong today). With the branch of government, I started support groups and one-on-one counseling. So that students could discuss their frustrations and feelings about being disabled in a safe space.  I also organized speakers to come and tell their stories or educate the student body on important issues facing the disabled community. The speakers included comedian Zach Anner, creator of the ALS Ice Bucket challenge, Pete and Nancy Frates and trans and disability activist, Eli Clare. Also as founder and chair of the branch of government, I spoke to the administration and faculty about the systematic challenges students faced like lack of accessible transportation on campus, lack of accessible syllabi and integrating disability into the conversation about a diverse student body.

      Outside of the council, I was a member of the Gay and Lesbian Council and spoke at many panels on the bisexual experience and the queer black experience. I also participated and helped organize Black Lives Matter protests on campus.

      <h3>3:00 - 3:30: Michele Friedner and Jamie Osborne - Accessing the Black Box of Accessibility?: Notes from Research in India</h3>
      <p>We are a medical anthropologist (Michele) and a city planner (Jamie) who work in urban India. In this talk we discuss both state and civil society efforts to advance "accessibility" of the built environment in India and we critically engage with what it means to label something "accessible" or "inaccessible." We draw on ethnographic and policy research and practice in order to argue that the concept of accessibility needs to be nuanced.</p>

      <h3>3:40 - 4:10: Patrick Smyth - Blind Hackers</h3>
      <p>"When encountering an inaccessible product or design, our first—and often most productive—response includes increasing awareness through outreach and education. But what about when these efforts aren't successful, and the need for access remains? This session is about eyes-free accessibility through the back door, focusing on members of the blind and low vision community that have scraped, soldered, coded, cracked, or hacked their way to accessing otherwise inaccessible designs. From talking Linux and dodging ebook DRM to eyes-free Pokemon, this talk will discuss the ingenuity and persistence of the blind community while opening a dialogue about the ethics of access. Come prepared to play—attendees will have the opportunity to interact with some of these approaches during the talk."</p>

      <h3>4:20 - 4:50: Whitney Quesenbery - Accessible elections (design for democracy)</h3>
      <p>What's the state of the art on accessible elections? We'll look at work to make information about voting easier to read and accessible for all - from voter registration to voter guides to voting systems. There are some great developments towards the promise of the Help America Vote Act, and places where good advocacy is still needed. I'll end with some ideas for how you can make elections more accessible and be an effective self-advocate. </p>
